        <p class="watch-story"><strong>When it comes to iconic vintage watches, few names spark as much reverence among collectors as the Universal Genève Polerouter.</strong> Designed in the early 1950s by a then 23-year-old Gérald Genta, the Polerouter represents the very beginning of a legendary career — a career that would later give us the Royal Oak and the Nautilus.</p>
        <p class="watch-story">The Polerouter wasn't just beautiful — it was purpose-built. Commissioned by Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) to accompany pilots on polar flights from Europe to North America, it had to withstand the extreme conditions and magnetic fields encountered over the North Pole. The result was a watch that was both robust and elegant — a rare blend even today.</p>
        <p class="watch-story">Over the years, Universal Genève released a variety of Polerouter references — from the earliest bumper automatic models to the later Microtor variants. But among them all, one reference, in particular, stands out in my opinion:</p>
      </div>

    <div class="detail-description">
      <h2>Reference 204612 – A Masterclass in Vintage Design</h2>
      <p class="watch-story">If you're hunting for the most complete expression of what makes the Polerouter special, look no further than ref. 204612. It may not be the rarest or the earliest, but in terms of aesthetic balance, character, and charm — it's hard to beat.</p>
      
      <h3>5 Details That Make This Reference Special</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Twisted Lugs That Make a Statement</strong><br>
          One of the defining features of Genta's original Polerouter design is the twisted lugs — and in reference 204612, they're boldly accentuated. They curve and catch the light in a way that adds depth and architectural flair. While other Polerouter references also have twisted lugs, the ones on the 204612 feel sharper, more expressive — like the designer's vision dialed up to eleven.
        </li>
        <li><strong>The Big Crown – Utility Meets Style</strong><br>
          This reference also comes with a larger-than-usual crown, which adds both practical and visual appeal. It's easier to wind, of course, but it also gives the case a vintage sportiness that balances well with the dressy elements of the dial. It's a small tweak that makes a big difference — and it just looks cool.
        </li>
        <li><strong>That Glossy Dial</strong><br>
          A standout feature of this reference is its high-gloss dial, which plays beautifully with light. It gives the watch a dual personality: under direct light, it sparkles with energy; in the shadows, it remains refined and understated. The clean text layout and applied indices help it walk the line between a dress watch and a casual everyday piece — a true chameleon.
        </li>
      </ol>

        <div style="flex:1; min-width:220px;">
          <h3 style="margin-top:0;">The Bracelet — Or the 'Zig-Zag', as I Call It</h3>
          <p class="watch-story">Now for the fun part: the bracelet. I lovingly refer to it as the zig-zag bracelet, and it's almost as rare — and as valuable — as the watch itself. In fact, it's not unusual to see this bracelet alone selling for nearly the same price as a head-only Polerouter.</p>
          <p class="watch-story">Its sharp, almost geometric design adds a bold finishing touch to the watch. It's one of those vintage bracelets that might look strange in pictures but comes to life in person. Interestingly, while I adore how it looks overall, I personally think it looks even better when the watch isn't on the wrist — as a sculptural piece, it's just beautiful to look at.</p>

      <ol start="4">
        <li><strong>Surprisingly Solid Construction</strong><br>
          When I first saw photos of the bracelet, I was expecting something lightweight and flimsy — a common issue with vintage bracelets. But I was pleasantly surprised. It's well-made, has its own weight, and feels durable. No, it's not going to compete with modern Omega or Rolex bracelets, but for its era, it holds up remarkably well.
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>A Quick Look Under the Hood</h3>
      <p class="watch-story">Inside, most 204612s feature the legendary Microtor movement — Universal Genève's revolutionary automatic caliber with a recessed rotor. It helped keep the case slim (relatively speaking) and is still celebrated today for its innovation and reliability.</p>
      <p class="watch-story">That said, this reference is a bit thicker than some might expect. This is largely due to the movement variations over the years. There was even a limited run of Polerouters using Valjoux 23 calibers — which, interestingly, didn't result in any notable change in thickness compared to the Sellita-powered reissues. A fun story, but arguably a bit pointless from a functional perspective.</p>
      
      <h2>The Verdict: A Vintage Gem That Holds Its Own</h2>
      <p class="watch-story">The Polerouter ref. 204612 isn't just a vintage watch — it's an experience. It represents a time when design, innovation, and utility came together with near-perfect balance. From its expressive lugs to its high-gloss dial, from the oversized crown to that unforgettable zig-zag bracelet — everything about it feels thoughtful, daring, and timeless.</p>
      <p class="watch-story">In a world filled with overhyped reissues and overpriced vintage pieces, this reference still manages to shine. And while prices have crept up in recent years, the 204612 remains one of the more attainable ways to wear a piece of Genta's genius on your wrist.</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        We often say that watches today are more about emotion than necessity — and that's exactly why pieces like the Polerouter 204612 matter. They're not just about telling time; they're about telling stories.<br>
        <strong>And in this case, it's one hell of a good story.</strong>
